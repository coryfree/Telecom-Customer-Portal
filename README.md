# Telecom-Customer-Portal
This application will serve as the customer portal for managing customer accounts with a large telecommunications 
firm. Users can register for an account and login. Users will only see their information and not another user’s data. 
Users can manage their devices, adding and removing devices at-will, selecting their phone number for each device, 
and assigning the data plans associated with their bill. Users can add new devices and assign them to a data plan. 
Users can see an estimated total cost of the monthly bill based on their selected plans.
